# Autosort Utility

## What is it?

The Autosort Utility is a GUI program which takes a directory of our plant pictures to sort, 
and allows the user to quickly sort them by pressing the left arrow to say the plant is green,
the right arrow to signify yellow, and the up arrow to signify that a plant is not there.

## Okay cool, how do I use it?

Simply launch the program, correctly fill in the directory fields, and get to sorting!
